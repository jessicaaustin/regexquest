baddies are zombies, which need to be transformed back into normal humans ?


one or more baddies
 - each has some text, with certain parts highlighted
 - may or may not be able to get all baddies with single regexp
to fight, type a regexp
 - can narrow down the string with multiple regexps, beat it by narrowing down to selected text
 - each time you "strike", the baddie strikes back


bosses:
 - transform a large piece of text into another (will definitely require multiple tries)

bonus games:
 - timed stuff
 - opposite game: baddies have regexps, you need to write text


game has different stages, with new types of baddies per stage
- exact match
- one or more chars
- optional chars
- digits / words / spaces


problems:
- need some way to discourage conditionals (/cat|hat/)
   - maybe fewer characters => more hit points?
