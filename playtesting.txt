Playtesting Notes:
==================

v0.1
----

sysadmin, very familiar with regexes (couldn't watch him play, but asked for feedback afterwards)
   didn't find the Book of Healing immediately
   agrees that it's a fun way to gain fluency, and that gaining fluency is an important goal
   likes the idea of progressively more complicated puzzles, while reinforcing the basics
   "You could possibly have some notion of an optimal regex vs something that works, but could be improved, at least for
    more complex things. So, rather than curing entirely, a clunky regexp might just put it into remission until the
    person comes up with a better one."

student, hasn't heard of regular expressions before, but I gave him a walkthrough (in person)
   referenced the Book of Healing all the time
   spaces aren't obvious -- maybe underscore them? (but want to avoid confusion with actual underscores...)
   BUG: in firefox on windows, the book of healing is showing up BEHIND the HUD
   it would be great to be able to review the puzzles after completion -- maybe when you talk to the villager?
   need to have a visual cue when you lose health -- if the sound is off then you don't really notice it happening
